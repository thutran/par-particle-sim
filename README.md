Run the `build_run.sh` with one argument for the max number of particles per grid cell.
For example, if we want to compile the code with the block size of 16 particles per cell, we should run: 
`./build_run.sh 16`

A new folder named `output_max_<block size>` will be created and all autograder outputs will be redirected to this folder.
